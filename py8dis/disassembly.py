I suppose this is maybe something to address later, but perhaps the context (or an additional "relocation context" argument) provided to the label maker could use the "in binary" address, so you could for example assign different labels to &900 depending on how it's being used (bear in mind it might be being used by part of code running at &9xx, which is why having a context showing the address in-binary would be necessary or at least v helpful to distinguish, but it also might be being used by part of code running elsewhere - if that code was nolt relocate the context would naturally be its in binary address, but if it was from other relocated code it could get confusing - admittedly an obscure case - but perhaps provided both bits of information to label maker even if most of time only one is used would be a good idea)

# TODO: We seem to assert some simple constants have their own value - is this wrong/weird?

# TODO: TobyLobster's Chuckie Egg disassembly shows that we're not necessarily doing the best we can when striking a balance between splitting/merging classifications and forcing the use of derived labels. l0c00 is being generated as an expression even though we should probably be splitting the byte data up so we can just label 0xc00 directly. I think part of the problem is we don't even *know* 0c00 is going to generate a label until we start str()-ing the instruction classifications - obviously we could make the disassembly process spit out labelled addresses explicitly during disassembly and that may well be the right approach, then label *names* are a str()-stage thing but the fact that an address will be labelled is known as soon as we finish tracing.

# TODO: Do we need to make some provision for user-controlled labelling at *binary* addresses, or without any "implicit, because unambiguous, move() application"? Imagine we have a move()d chunk of code - we want a label on that code *at the binary address* so the LDA rom_copy,Y:STA ram_copy,Y loop can use a custom label for rom_copy. I *think* at the moment it would be hard/impossible for user code to successfully define the "rom_copy" label.

# TODO: Note that in move.py, l0908 is an automatically generated label which we would like to heuristically assign a non-None move_id, but this doesn't happen yet.
