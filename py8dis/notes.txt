load()/move() region notes:

we need to emit something for each byte in a load()ed region
move()s kind of create "holes" in a load()ed region where we have data but we emit it via a pseudopc block inline
*because* we emit labels for the address after the end of a block at the end of that block, we would risk generating duplicate labels if two pseudopc blocks or two load()ed regions were adjacent
- obviously we could simply avoid emitting any given label more than once, but this could still be confusing, e.g. we might emit:

* = $2000
!pseudopc $900 {
.do_a
    lda #65
    rts
.do_b
}
    blah blah; potentially lots of it
!pseudopc $903 {
; this is "do_b" - but we already emitted do_b label earlier, which isn't *wrong* (do_b will have value $903 as required) but is highly unhelpful
    lda #66
    rts
}

this example does show however that we *cannot* merge adjacent pseudopc blocks in all cases, because they needn't be consecutive in the "source".

i suppose although these are *not* overlapping move() blocks, the do_b label kind of overlaps and this confusing-but-correct behaviour would probably be automatically fixed by having labels associated with a specific pseudopc block

do we have a similar problem if we have adjacent load()s? i suspect we don't really, because that is morally equivalent to a single load() of a concatenated data file. we might (if I support this) wish to save() two adjacent ranges of memory out separately in a beebasm version of the output, but that is really independent of how we load()ed the data.

what about deciding which labels we need to emit up-front because they will never get a chance to be done inline? the addresses we will "see" inline are the regions *including* the end addresses, with the move()-ed regions taken into account. we do need to be careful to also generate the end-of-source label after a pseudopc move()-ed region


What if a program contains a top-level relocate down routine (e.g. it loads high from disc then relocates itself over disc workspace) *and* within that relocated down code contains some fragments of code it copies elsewhere? I am reluctant to allow "nested" relocations, but is this going to work at all?
- without nested relocations we would have to move() the non-overlapping chunks separately
- it probably (but would be good to test; gfoot's Repton 2 disassembly may do this) works for the common case where only the start/end addresses of the fragments are referenced - not thinking too clearly about this TBH...





different "modes" for user interactions with the move system:
(for the moment going with terminology "binary" and "runtime" but not final yet)

"runtime address" mode is how things worked before the refactor
this mode probably only works (maybe we actually detect this and error out) if all move()s have non-overlapping destinations (not too sure about this)
label(X, "foo") associates label "foo" with the unmodified value X. Internally, if (as there will be if we enforce no overlapping) X is within a move() destination, we will probably implicitly tag the label with that move ID.
expr(X, "foo") interprets X as a runtime address; internally X gets mapped back onto a binary address for the core disassembler to use
- ditto byte(X), word(X), string(X) etc

"binary address" mode is new and probably (?) not the default
expr(X, "foo") etc interpret X as binary address with no translation - this implicitly disambiguates where move()s have overlapping destinations
label(X, "foo") interprets X as a runtime address and does not modify it, so this is "inconsistent" with expr() et al - so label() behaves the same in both modes
label(b2r(X), "foo") maps a binary address X to a runtime address (which may be a no-op) - this is useful if we are looking at a WIP disassembly, we see that code in the binary at 0xc221 which maybe gets relocated to 0x4300 (but we have no way to easily "see" that 0x4300 address, although maybe our hex dump should be toggleable between binary and runtime address constants) and we want to put a label on 0x4300 by saying label(b2r(0xc221), "foo")




relocate_down_move_id = move(0x900, 0x1900, 0x6000) # move ID 1
fragment_a_move_id = move(0x70, 0x9e3, 0x20) # move ID 2
fragment_b_move_id = move(0x70, 0x2201, 0x16) # move ID 3

we end up with:
move_id[0x1900] == 1
...
move_id[0x19e2] == 1
move_id[0x19e3] == 2
...
move_id[0x2002] == 2
move_id[0x2003] == 1
...

so move ID 1 is no longer contiguous, but I think we can cope with that - it just means when we emit our "fragments" internally the real key is (move_id, start address of this run of move_id) not just "move_id".


our model is (partly just to match how current released py8dis works, but also because it does feel fairly logical) that the user wants to work entirely in terms of "runtime" addresses, as if the move()s have been applied

for label(), we *can* tolerate amibiguity over move ID - although we'd prefer to have an answer, either user-supplied or heuristically generated, for good quality output - because we are assigning the supplied value unaltered to a label name. It's completely normal to have labels which refer to addresses that are not part of the binary (screen memory or working RAM, for example).

for expr() etc, we *can't* tolerate ambiguity over move ID, because internally we need to attach the expr() etc to the corresponding instruction bytes *at the binary address*. (as a sub case of this, we should error if there is *no* binary address corresponding, because such an expr() will never be emitted and is thus useless and probably an error when the user meant something else.)

rather than have set_current_move_id() explicitly or implicitly, I am thinking some kind of with structure:

with use_move_id(fragment_a_move_id) as dummy: # do we need the 'as' clause to keep Python happy or is it optional?
    label(0x70, "foo") # associates 16-bit value "0x70" with name "foo" in move ID 2

we might even allow nested use_move_id(), so we can do:

with use_move_id(relocate_down_move_id):
    label(0x900, "start")
    with use_move_id(fragment_a_move_id):
        label(0x70, "foo")
	expr(0x904, "foo") # not part of fragment_a_move_id but convenient to write it here without user having to "undo" the fragment_a_move_id somehow
    with ue_move_id(fragment_b_move_id):
        label(0x70, "bar")
	expr(0x114d, "bar")

Internal the with code is probably just pushing and popping move_ids at the end of a list which we consult when we need to translate an address into (for labels) a move ID associated with that address or (for expr() etc) translate a runtime address into a binary address.

This is all done pre-tracing; at trace time we are probably still working with the static memory model in my current py8dis sketch.

[Aside: there's probably no big problem with making the "static" memory space >64K; that way (for example) if you had a 48K binary to disassemble and you need to be able to move() bits of it all over the 64K "real" address space to reflect the runtime situation, you could load() it at 0x10000 where it's out of the way and move() all of it to the corresponding addresses with overlaps as required. But probably no reason to go out of my way to complicate things even slightly with this yet.]
