load()/move() region notes:

we need to emit something for each byte in a load()ed region
move()s kind of create "holes" in a load()ed region where we have data but we emit it via a pseudopc block inline
*because* we emit labels for the address after the end of a block at the end of that block, we would risk generating duplicate labels if two pseudopc blocks or two load()ed regions were adjacent
- obviously we could simply avoid emitting any given label more than once, but this could still be confusing, e.g. we might emit:

* = $2000
!pseudopc $900 {
.do_a
    lda #65
    rts
.do_b
}
    blah blah; potentially lots of it
!pseudopc $903 {
; this is "do_b" - but we already emitted do_b label earlier, which isn't *wrong* (do_b will have value $903 as required) but is highly unhelpful
    lda #66
    rts
}

this example does show however that we *cannot* merge adjacent pseudopc blocks in all cases, because they needn't be consecutive in the "source".

i suppose although these are *not* overlapping move() blocks, the do_b label kind of overlaps and this confusing-but-correct behaviour would probably be automatically fixed by having labels associated with a specific pseudopc block

do we have a similar problem if we have adjacent load()s? i suspect we don't really, because that is morally equivalent to a single load() of a concatenated data file. we might (if I support this) wish to save() two adjacent ranges of memory out separately in a beebasm version of the output, but that is really independent of how we load()ed the data.

what about deciding which labels we need to emit up-front because they will never get a chance to be done inline? the addresses we will "see" inline are the regions *including* the end addresses, with the move()-ed regions taken into account. we do need to be careful to also generate the end-of-source label after a pseudopc move()-ed region
